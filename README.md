# 🧬 Capability Evolver

[Chinese Docs](README.zh-CN.md)

**"Evolution is not optional. Adapt or die."**

**Three lines**
- **What it is**: A protocol-constrained self-evolution engine for AI agents.
- **Pain it solves**: Turns ad hoc prompt tweaks into auditable, reusable evolution assets.
- **Use in 30 seconds**: `node index.js` to generate a GEP-guided evolution prompt.

Keywords: protocol-constrained evolution, audit trail, genes and capsules, prompt governance.

## Try It Now (Minimal)

```bash
node index.js
```

## What It Does

The **Capability Evolver** inspects runtime history, extracts signals, selects a Gene/Capsule, and emits a strict GEP protocol prompt to guide safe evolution.

## Who This Is For / Not For

**For**
- Teams maintaining agent prompts and logs at scale
- Users who need auditable evolution traces (Genes, Capsules, Events)
- Environments requiring deterministic, protocol-bound changes

**Not For**
- One-off scripts without logs or history
- Projects that require free-form creative changes
- Systems that cannot tolerate protocol overhead

## Features

- **Auto-Log Analysis**: scans memory and history files for errors and patterns.
- **Self-Repair Guidance**: emits repair-focused directives from signals.
- **GEP Protocol**: standardized evolution with reusable assets.
- **Mutation + Personality Evolution (GEP v1.4)**: each evolution run is gated by an explicit Mutation object and an evolvable PersonalityState.
- **One-Command Evolution**: `node index.js` to generate the prompt.

## Typical Use Cases

- Harden a flaky agent loop by enforcing validation before edits
- Encode recurring fixes as reusable Genes and Capsules
- Produce auditable evolution events for review or compliance

## Anti-Examples

- Rewriting entire subsystems without signals or constraints
- Using the protocol as a generic task runner
- Producing changes without recording EvolutionEvent

## FAQ

**Does this edit code automatically?**
No. It generates a protocol-bound prompt and assets that guide evolution.

**Do I need to use all GEP assets?**
No. You can start with default Genes and extend over time.

**Is this safe in production?**
Use review mode and validation steps. Treat it as a safety-focused evolution tool, not a live patcher.

## Roadmap

- Add a one-minute demo workflow
- Add a public changelog
- Add a comparison table vs alternatives

## GEP Protocol (Auditable Evolution)

This repo includes a protocol-constrained prompt mode based on GEP (Genome Evolution Protocol).

- **Structured assets** live in `assets/gep/`:
  - `assets/gep/genes.json`
  - `assets/gep/capsules.json`
  - `assets/gep/events.jsonl`
- **Selector** logic uses extracted signals to prefer existing Genes/Capsules and emits a JSON selector decision in the prompt.
- **Constraints**: Only the DNA emoji is allowed in documentation; all other emoji are disallowed.

## Usage

### Standard Run (Automated)
```bash
node index.js
```

### Review Mode (Human-in-the-Loop)
```bash
node index.js --review
```

### Continuous Loop
```bash
node index.js --loop
```

## Versioning (SemVer)

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- MAJOR: incompatible changes
- MINOR: backward-compatible features
- PATCH: backward-compatible bug fixes

## Changelog

### v1.4.2
- Add loop gating: do not start a new cycle until the previous run is solidified (prevents fast empty cycles).
- Preserve `last_solidify` when writing solidify state (merge instead of overwrite).

### v1.4.1
- Add execute-by-default bridge: after generating the GEP prompt, emit `sessions_spawn(...)` to spawn an executor agent.
- Write prompt artifacts to `memory/` for reliable handoff and auditing.

### v1.4.0
- Add explicit Mutation protocol (repair/optimize/innovate) and require Mutation per evolution run.
- Add evolvable PersonalityState with small PersonalityMutation steps and natural selection statistics.
- Extend EvolutionEvent with `mutation_id` and `personality_state`; record both into Memory Graph events.
- Add `scripts/gep_personality_report.js` to observe personality success rates and convergence.

### v1.3.1
- Release preparation for v1.3.1.

### v1.3.0
- Release preparation for v1.3.0.

### v1.2.0
- Memory Graph v2 and A2A exchange protocol integration.

### v1.1.0
- Public build/publish pipeline, prompt budget enforcement, and structured GEP asset storage.

## Configuration & Decoupling

This skill is designed to be **environment-agnostic**. It uses standard OpenClaw tools by default.

### Local Overrides (Injection)
You can inject local preferences (e.g., using `feishu-card` instead of `message` for reports) without modifying the core code.

**Method 1: Environment Variables**
Set `EVOLVE_REPORT_TOOL` in your `.env` file:
```bash
EVOLVE_REPORT_TOOL=feishu-card
```

**Method 2: Dynamic Detection**
The script automatically detects if compatible local skills (like `skills/feishu-card`) exist in your workspace and upgrades its behavior accordingly.
